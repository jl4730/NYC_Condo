## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using NYC apartment sales data from 2003 to 2017 to better understand:

1. How did the financial crisis impact CONDO sales in 2008?
2. Will NYC CONDO price drop significantly in the future?
3. What was the average price increase for CONDO sales each year?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook alongside with the raw data used to run the script. I've also provided the HTML file and an additional `.py` file to help user get what they want.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to NYC finance department for the data.  You can find the data from the NYC finance department website.  And please feel free to use the code here as you would like!
